# the python section should contain:
#   home: a path pointing to the Python home directory, typically relative to the tool executable
#   library_name: the Python library within the home directory.
#   paths: paths to add to the Python sys.path before launching.
#
# the app section should contain:
#   identifier: the package identifier of the application. in this case, Nion Swift
